Using Shell and AppleScript to display Spotify notifications.


**For the record:** *I'm fully aware that it displays a dialog box and not a notification. This is because AppleScript notifications have no property "icon," whereas a dialog box does. Displaying it as such allows for album artwork, and the code can be easily changed to be solely notifications without artwork.*
